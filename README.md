# JTetris
We are developing this Java Tetris clone just for fun and for the willing of learning the programing language.

# Challenge
- Code the entire game using not a single framework, using just interface components from `java.awt` and `javax.swing`.

# Expectations
- The program should have integrated basically all Tetris clasic game rules.
- Include files management for Score points (leaderboards).
- Include not just a single Frame but multiple Frames like a Main Menu that could have options, adjustments (*Theme* selection: Dark, White, System), dificulty, and other options that could be interesting to think in some future.
