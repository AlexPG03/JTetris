# JTetris
We are developing this Java Tetris clone just for fun and for the willing of learning the language.

# Challenge
- Code the entire game using not a single framework, using just interface components from `javax.awt` and `javax.swing`.

# Expectations
- The program should have integrated basically all Tetris clasic game rules.
- Include files management (leaderboards).
- Include not just a single Frame but multiple Frames like a Main Menu that could have options, adjustments (Theme selection), dificulty, and other options that could be interesting to think in some future.
